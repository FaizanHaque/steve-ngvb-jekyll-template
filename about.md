This website serves as a personal repository of resources as well as a programming portfolio that anyone is welcome to use. However, if you use my code, please let me know and refrain from using them in your class assignments unless permitted. My goal is to arrange everything in a manner that optimizes relearning potentially useful things I may use again in more than a year and require a refresher.

This website was created with the help of this guide: http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/
