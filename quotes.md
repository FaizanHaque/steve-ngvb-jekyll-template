Here is a list of quotes that I enjoyed reading, or found really interesting and would like to come back to ponder.

"All of physics is either impossible or trivial. It is impossible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial." - Ernest Rutherford


"Science is not about certainty. Science is about finding the most reliable way of thinking at the present level of knowledge. Science is extremely reliable; it’s not certain. In fact, not only is it not certain, but it’s the lack of certainty that grounds it. Scientific ideas are credible not because they are sure but because they’re the ones that have survived all the possible past critiques, and they’re the most credible because they were put on the table for everybody’s criticism."
-Carlo Rovelli

"One should make a short and precise note of every question one comes upon in reading or in conversation or in free reflection. One after another; and from timet to time look through the old questions, and from time to time look through the old questions, and perhaps also systemize them in some way. Above all there is a great satisfaction in seeing how one easily and gradually earns to answer many questions which one hardly knew how to formulate at first, much less to which to work out.

Secondly, in this way one learns how to condense hazy obscurities into sharply defined questions. That is enormously important. It's trivial remark that doing this puts one halfway to the solution.

Thirdly, one then has an abundance of questions ready for asking the right people, in case one comes across them. But theat is the true key for opening their minds. Nothng is shabbier than feeling: now God has granted me the oppurtunity to meet this man, and I say before him open-mouthed; how much  I might have asked him–but nothing at all  occured to me.

It seems to me, however, the principle value lies in the habit of working over hazy obscurities until they are reduced to sharply defined questions.
This is especially so for questions that lie far off from one's own science." - Paul Ehrenfest on notebooks.
